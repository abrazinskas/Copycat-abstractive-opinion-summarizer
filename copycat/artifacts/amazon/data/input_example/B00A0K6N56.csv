B00A0K6N56	This Pet Roller is the best that I have found . It really works great on pet hair . I like to use it on the couch and the pet beds . I use it after I vacuum to get the last hair off . It 's the best product out there for this purpose .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0K6N56	So helpful in my battle against fleas . These rollers pick up living and dead fleas--not to mention dog hair and almost everything else . Not the most earth-friendly ( at the rate that I 've been going through them ) , but necessary at this time and a great help .	5.0	health_and_personal_care

B00A0K6N56	The best sticky tape ever ! It picks up everything and holds well while being able to cover large areas in a nifty !

B00A0K6N56	This product is a " must " for homes with chronically shedding pets . Once one gets the knack of peeling off the used adhesive paper , the chore of picking up shed hair becomes a snap .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0K6N56	Very large , very sticky , picks up cat hair , kitty litter and all manner of flotsam and jetsam . Very easy to peal off the used layer , as it comes off in a spiral , not one flat sheet ... very nice improvement over products I 've used in the past .	5.0	health_and_personal_care

B00A0K6N56	I can recommend this product highly to anyone that has pets or to just pick up little pits and pieces without having to drag in the vacuum cleaner .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0K6N56	Unfortunately , the quality of the product has fallen . The thickness of the adhesive sheets is so thin and fragile that they tear when trying to remove them from the roll . Likewise , we have found several instances when card board was rolled up in the rolls instead of adhesive backed clear sheets . Too bad a great product is no more !	2.0	health_and_personal_care

B00A0K6N56	Not the easiest to take used paper off . In fact , I waste more time TRYING to find the beginning than I actually use rolling the couch ! wish the tear off here was more pronounced as to not waste my time !	3.0	health_and_personal_care

B00A0K6N56	The pet roller refills for the Cleaning Roller each have 50 sheets and economically is a good bargain .

Each sheet goes a long way before having to strip it off .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
