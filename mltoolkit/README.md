# Machine Learning Toolkit

This repository provides three submodules useful for development of machine learning models.
They cover two main aspects: data processing and the machine learning modelling.

* **MLDP** - creation of data processing flows and computational steps for online data processing.
* **MLMO** - provides modelling interfaces and neural layers, such as GRU encoders/decoders.
* **MLUtils** - contains utility classes and functions are that used by the previous two.

For more information about specific submodules, please refer to the corresponding folders.
